1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When multiple people are collaborating or if you intend on keeping your work backed up.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

auto pushing may update files before you feel they are ready.
